This directory and below contains code from IBM licensed under the
"Modified BSD license."  It was extracted unmodified from the IBM Cell
SDK 3.0 library source tarball, lib_source.tar, typically found in
/opt/cell/sdk/src/lib_source.tar.

We've done this because this code doesn't come unpacked in the native
(cell) installation of the SDK 3.0, and thus we can't just add a
-I/path/to/this/stuff in our Makefiles.  If this changes, we'll delete
this code from here, and fix our Makefiles.  In the meanwhile, this
reduces the probability of build problems.
